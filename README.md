# Tally – Your Smart Budget Planner
Tally is a React-based budget planner designed to help you track income, allocate spending, and save efficiently. It automatically divides your salary into different categories and ensures a rolling budget without monthly resets.

## Features
✅ Salary Input – Enter your monthly salary, and Tally automatically distributes it.
✅ Auto Budgeting – 30% of your salary is allocated to savings, while the rest is divided into spending categories.
✅ Categorized Transactions – Track expenses under "fun money" and "necessities" (e.g., rent, groceries).
✅ Rolling Budget – Unspent money is carried over instead of resetting each month.
✅ Savings Growth – Any leftover spending budget at the end of the month moves to savings.
✅ Transaction Logging – Add and track expenses separately.
✅ Simple Navigation – Switch between salary input and transaction logging pages effortlessly.
